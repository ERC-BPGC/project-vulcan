The Electronics and Robotics Club (ERC) of BITS Goa is a diverse group of students with a passion for various aspects of science and engineering, ranging from electronics to machine learning and mechanical design. Established in 2008, it is one of the oldest clubs on campus and has since evolved into a platform for learning and experimenting with different fields of engineering, particularly robotics. The club welcomes not only electronics engineers but also mechanical enthusiasts and dynamic coders. We are organized into multiple teams, each working on a wide variety of projects, including hardware design, open-source libraries, and building robots from scratch. Members are encouraged to share their experiences and expertise, with weekly discussion sessions, demonstrations, and presentations fostering collaboration. Over the years, the club has shifted its focus from participating in robotics competitions to taking on more research-oriented projects and real-world problem statements. As robotics is a rapidly evolving field, we aim to stay updated with the latest research and industry developments while also diving deep into various subfields. Additionally, we frequently work on exhibition projects for the annual technical fest and other events throughout the year. The ERC is open to anyone with a general interest in engineering and robotics, so if you're keen to explore and learn, feel free to reach out and join us.
